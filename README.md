Final Project for CU Boulder DTSA 5509: Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning.

In this project I built a machine learning models to predict heart arrhythmia from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The purpose of this project is to train classification algorithm to attempt to predict various types of heart arrhythmias based on ECG Data.
